- Visual of totality of eclipse over a map
- What was the average totality duration for the 2024 total solar eclipse by state
- Create a summary of the two partial eclipses seen in Missouri

First Quest: What was the average totality duration for the 2024 total solar eclipse 
 - find length of totality as numeric
    - mutate to create a new column that subtracts the end time of totality from beginning time
    - change the datetime variable to numeric 
 - grouping by state, create a new column and use the mean function 

Second Quest: Visual of totality of eclipse over a map
- use the same column of length of totality as numeric 
- Using some map data from hw 5
  - map <- map_data("world") %>%
  filter(region %in% c("USA"))
  - looking at eclipse_total_2024
    - get length of totality in seconds 
    - mutate for end - beginning, and as.numeric 
  - x and y axis are long and lat from map data (geom_polygon)
  - x and y axis are lon and lat grouped by eclipse 3 (geom_point)
  - use Cartesian coordinates

Third Quest: Creating a summary of the partial eclipses seen in Missouri
- filter the two partial eclipses by state for only Missouri data
- find total length of both eclipses
- join together the two data frames
- find difference between duration
- transform seconds into minutes
- depending on time, visual a distribution of the eclipse durations
